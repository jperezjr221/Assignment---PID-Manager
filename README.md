# Assignment---PID-Manager
The goal of this assignment is to create an operating system's PID manager that is responsible for managing process identifiers. When a process is first created, it is assigned a unique pid by the pid manager. The pid is returned to the pid manager when the process completes execution, and the manager may later reassign this pid.
